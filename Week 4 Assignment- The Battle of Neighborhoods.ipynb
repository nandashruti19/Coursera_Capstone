    "For this Capstone project, I am creating a hypothetical scenario for a concept Indian restaurant Chain who wants to explore opening an authentic Indian restaurant in Toronto neighborhood. The idea behind this project is that there is an Indian restaurant in New York City that got a huge response from audience and it might present a great opportunity for this food chain to think about expanding its chain in Toronto, Canada. With the purpose in mind to be as popular as the restaurant in NYC, finding the location to open such a restaurant is one of the most important decisions for this restaurant chain and I am designing this project to help them find the most suitable location."
